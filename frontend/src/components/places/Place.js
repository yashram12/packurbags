            from the city of Bangalore and has emerged as the perfect weekend
            getaway for its people. Even though it is most well-known for its
            viewpoints and its greenery, Nandi Hills is also a popular
            historical fortress that is home to a number of temples, monuments
            and shrines."

          be found in the area. His summer residence can still be found in Nandi
          Hills. The house was called Tashk-e-Jannat, whose painted walls,
          intricate archways, high pillars and artfully crafted ceilings attract
          tourists and visitors even today. Nandi Hills is also home to some
